Microsoft uses SDDL (Security Descriptor Definition Language) strings to describe ACLs on various objects.  The sddl.py module attempts to make it easy to programmatically extract information from SDDL strings.

SDDLTranslate.py is a Python script for extracting the information and formatting the output into a human-readable format.
